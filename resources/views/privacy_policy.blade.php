                        you provide while using our Service or in some other manner. This may include identifying information, such as your name,
                        nickname, zip code, email address and telephone number, physical description, and, if you choose to become a paid user
                        of the service, financial information. You may also provide us your photos, a personal description and information about

                        and the links you click. If we advertise, we (or third parties) may use certain data collected on our Service

                    <p> <br />   We embed web beacons on web pages, ads, and emails. These tiny, invisible graphics are used to access
                        cookies and track user activities (such as how many times a page is viewed). We use web beacons to measure the
                        popularity of our features and services. Ad companies also use pixel tags to measure the number of ads displayed
                        and their performance (such as how many people clicked on an ad).   <br /><br />  </p>

                    <p> <br />   We use automated applications, such as Google Analytics, to track our visitors and evaluate usage of our
                        site and, to the extent permitted, our mobile app. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our services.
                        We use these tools to help us improve our services, performance and user experiences. We may use and share your
                        personal information with such third parties as further described in this Privacy Policy.  </p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p> <br />   If you are using our mobile app (currently available to beta testers only), we use mobile device IDs
                        (the unique identifier assigned to a device by the manufacturer), or Advertising IDs (for iOS 6 and later),
                        instead of cookies, to recognize you. We do this to store your preferences and track your use of our app. Unlike
                        cookies, device IDs cannot be deleted, but Advertising IDs can be reset in "Settings" on your iPhone. Ad companies
                        also use device IDs or Advertising IDs to track your use of the app, track the number of ads displayed, measure
                        ad performance and display ads that are more relevant to you. Analytics companies use device IDs to track information
                        about app usage.   <br /><br />  </p>

                        to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. We do not provide any non-anonymized

                        third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis or
                        other business purposes. For example, we may engage a data provider who may collect web log data from you (including IP
                        address and information about your browser or operating system), or place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to
                        enable you to receive customized ads or content. The cookies may reﬂect de-identified demographic or other data linked

                        Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites
                        and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or
                        online services. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information we collect and that is why
                        we provide the opt-out links above. However, we do not recognize or respond to any DNT signals, as the Internet industry
                        works toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.
                        <br />   <br />  <strong>Third Party Websites</strong> <br />   <br />
                        There are a number of places on our Service where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate
                        under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on a link posted by another user through our Service, you may be
                        taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information,
                        including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on
                        those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking
                        on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.  </p>

                        provided below. You also may close your account at any time by visiting the settings page for your account.
                        If you close your account, we will retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and
                        record keeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, enforce our Terms of Use, take actions we deem necessary to
                        protect the integrity of our Service or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if
                        certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that
                        information will be subject to those third parties' policies.  </p>

                        You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features
                        of our Service because such information may be required in order for you to register as user; purchase products or services;
                        participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions.   <br /><br />

                        However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do
                        not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, chats, or other communications will always
                        remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should
                        avoid sending personal information through insecure email.  </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Information you provide about yourself while using our Service</strong><strong><br /></strong> <br />
                        We provide areas on our Service where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others.
                        Such postings are governed by our Terms of Use. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable pages,
                        that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email
                        address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the
                        information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information  </p>

                    <p><strong>Age Restrictions and Children Policy</strong><strong><br /></strong> <br />
                        Although our Service is provided to a general audience, we restrict the use of our service to individuals age 16 and above.
                        We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use personal information from children under the age of 16.  </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>No Rights of Third Parties</strong><strong><br /></strong> <br />
                        This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal
                        information relating to users of the website.  </p>

                    <p><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong><strong><br /></strong> <br />   We will occasionally update this Privacy
                        Policy to reflect changes in the law, our data collection and use practices, the features of our Service, or advances in
                        technology. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy,
                        which will be posted in the footer of our website, and you should regularly check for the most recent version,
                        which is the version that applies. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you of the changes by
                        reasonable means, which could include notifications through the Services or via email. Please review the changes carefully.
                        Your continued use of the Services following the posting of changes to this policy will mean you consent to and accept those changes.
                        If you do not consent to such changes you can disable your account.
